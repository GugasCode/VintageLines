## VintageLines
### A snazzy package that gives you relative line numbers for Sublime Text 2's Vintage mode.

### Important
VintageLines is still in early development, and isn't quite ready for package control. If you're going to use now, be sure to copy all of the icons into the ```Theme - Default``` sublime package root. Oh, and if you have more than 60 lines viewable on screen at a time, numbers over 60 won't show up yet.

VintageLines gives you relative line numbers while in command mode! How snazzy!
